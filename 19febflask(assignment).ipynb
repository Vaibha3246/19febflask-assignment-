    "# Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "# Flask is a micro web framework for Python, designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It provides the essentials for building web applications without imposing a specific structure on the project. Here are some advantages of Flask:\n",
    "# Simplicity: Flask follows a minimalistic design philosophy, allowing developers to keep their codebase simple and only use the components they need. This simplicity makes it easy for developers to learn and get started quickly.\n",
    "# Flexibility: Flask gives developers the flexibility to choose their libraries and components for various tasks. It doesn't enforce a specific way of doing things, allowing developers to make decisions based on their project's requirements.\n",
    "# Modularity: Flask is designed to be modular, allowing developers to use extensions for specific functionalities. This modularity enables developers to add features as needed, making it suitable for a variety of applications.\n",
    "# Learning Curve: Flask has a relatively simple and straightforward learning curve. This makes it an excellent choice for beginners and those who prefer to gradually learn and understand the components of a web framework.\n",
    "# Extensibility: Flask can be easily extended with various third-party extensions. These extensions cover a wide range of functionalities, including authentication, database integration, and more. This extensibility allows developers to add features to their applications without starting from scratch.\n",
    "# Community and Documentation: Flask has an active and supportive community. It also has comprehensive documentation, making it easier for developers to find help, resources, and examples when working on their projects.\n",
    "# Scalability: While Flask is often considered more lightweight compared to full-stack frameworks like Django, it is still scalable. Developers have the freedom to structure their application in a way that suits their scalability needs.\n",
    "# Werkzeug and Jinja2: Flask is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and uses the Jinja2 template engine. Werkzeug provides a set of utilities for building web applications, and Jinja2 is a powerful and expressive template engine. These components contribute to the effectiveness and simplicity of Flask.\n",
    "# In summary, Flask's advantages include simplicity, flexibility, modularity, a manageable learning curve, extensibility, strong community support, and scalability. These features make Flask a popular choice for a wide range of web development projects."

    "# Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "# In Flask, routing refers to the mechanism of directing incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate view function\n",
    "# or endpoint in the application. An app route is a decorator provided by Flask that is used to bind a function\n",
    "# to a URL so that when a request is made to that URL, the associated function is executed. This process is\n",
    "# central to how Flask handles different parts of a web application.\n",
    "# Why Use App Routes:\n",
    "# Organizing Code: App routes help organize the code by associating specific functionality with specific URLs. This makes the codebase more maintainable and modular.\n",
    "# Handling User Requests: Routes determine how the application responds to user requests. By defining routes, you specify what should happen when a user accesses different parts of the application.\n",
    "# RESTful API Design: In the case of building RESTful APIs, routes play a crucial role in defining the structure of the API. Different routes correspond to different API endpoints, each serving a specific purpose.\n",
    "# Dynamic Content: Dynamic routes allow the application to handle variable data in URLs, enabling the creation of dynamic and data-driven web pages.\n",
    "# App routes are a fundamental concept in Flask, and they are essential for building web applications where different URLs correspond to different functionalities or views within the application."
